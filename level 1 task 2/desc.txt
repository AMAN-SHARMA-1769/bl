🌐 Task 2 – Responsive Landing Page | @CodSoft Internship (Level 1)

Proud to share my Task 2 project as part of the @CodSoft Level 1 Internship – a fully responsive Landing Page designed using HTML and CSS. 🖥️✨

📌 About the Task:
This project involved creating a clean, user-friendly landing page layout that demonstrates core frontend skills. From structured sections, headers, and footers to grid layouts, color schemes, and typography, every element was thoughtfully crafted.

💡 What I Practiced:

HTML structure: Semantic tags, responsive sections

CSS styling: Padding, margin, flex/grid layout, color palette

Visual hierarchy and UI consistency

Clean and maintainable code

This task was not only a great way to strengthen my HTML/CSS fundamentals, but also encouraged me to think creatively and focus on design details that improve user experience.

💼 Excited to move ahead with the next challenges!
