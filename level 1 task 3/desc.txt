🔢 Task 3 – Basic Calculator Web App | @CodSoft Internship – Level 1 🔥

I’m excited to share the third task I completed during my internship with @CodSoft – a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🧮💻

💡 Project Overview:
This calculator features an interactive interface where users can perform:
➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
➗ Division

✨ It includes:

A live display screen for user input and results

CSS Grid layout for perfectly aligned buttons

JavaScript event listeners to handle clicks

Logic using if-else statements and basic operators to perform calculations

This project helped me improve my skills in DOM manipulation, responsive layout design, and interactive UI creation — all with clean and beginner-friendly code!
